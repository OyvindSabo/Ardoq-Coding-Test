# Chatbot

This is a very simple chatbot utilizing the CoinMarketCap API for Python.
To run the bot, make sure to have Flask and coinmarketcap installed, then run the chatbot.py file. The server will start and you can
interact with the bot at localhost:5000.

The bot understands basic greeting commands and can check the price and/or market capitalization of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero.
